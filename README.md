# dotfiles
my personal dotfiles, which make my FreeBSD desktop experience a bit more cozy.
If anyone is interested, I am using:
- spectrwm window manager
- dmenu
- vifm file manager
- cmus music player
- amfora gemini browser
- broot file browser
- rclone for cloud service cloning
- vim text editor
- pcmanfm ocassionaly
- xterm terminal
- lsd instead of ls
- alacritty (mostly for troubleshooting, when xterm has some problems)
- ibus/anthy for keyboard switcher
- feh for desktop wallpaper
- redshift for eye protection
- picom 

I like to customize my terminal by setting .Xresources, this sets colors and font for xterm. I imported colors from Nord theme, which I like. 
I customize my terminal experience by setting .bashrc and most of the config is in .profile.
