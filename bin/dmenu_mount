# Gives a dmenu prompt to mount unmounted drives and Android phones. If
# they're in /etc/fstab, they'll be mounted automatically. Otherwise, you'll
# be prompted to give a mountpoint from already existing directories. If you
# input a novel directory, it will prompt you to create that directory.
#
# This is basically a script from taken Luke Smith - https://lukesmith.xyz - so all credit goes to him.
# I modified the script slightly to check the dir $HOME/tmp for new mountpoints and to use dmenu to notify me 
# about the process, instead of using notify-send or whatever Luke used. For this, I used the dmenu_notify function  
# and I also customized the dmenu calls with variables OPTS and FONT to suit my needs. 
#
# This script uses "doas" instead of "sudo", so if you don't have "doas" installed, replace it back with "sudo -A". 
# This script uses "simple-mtpfs", so make sure you have it installed.
#
# TODO: I may add some error checking and error notification functionality later, because right now, even if the mounting fails,
# you won't get any feedback, you'll get the standard notification "USB/Android mounting: $chosen mounted to $mp",
